The code was started by Civilwargeeky. A large part of the development comes from him, and thanks to him, I am here today making some changes that might help. The main idea is to change a few things that make the code more functional for Minecraft 1.20 and especially for use with other mods.

For now, the changes will only be in the Quarry and Quarry Receive code. I will add others in the future.
